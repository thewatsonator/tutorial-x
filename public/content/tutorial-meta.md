### SPA key points

This is a single page application which:

- Uses a component system.
- No external state manager
- No React context
- Only 1 class with lifecycle method has been written

Ant.Design component system does use context, state, and lifecycle methods but we do not need to manage these. By using a component system as the building blocks for our SPA we can avoid the need to use the more complex aspects of React.

### Component System Ant.Design

The component system used can be found at https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce

### Build tool `Create React App`

The build system uses `Create React App` and `React App Rewired` with a `config-overrides.js` file.

### Code Base
