You can use a build tool like Webpack in conjunction with Babel to compiler modern javascript syntax to ES5 syntax so the javascript is compatible with older browsers.

Create React App created by Facebook is a CLI tool which allows you to quickly create a comprehensive build setup.

Create React App is popular but opinionated. If you need to make adjustments to the Webpack config in Create React App you can either 'eject' the configuration and manage all dependencies yourself or you can use React App Rewired to make minor customisations without ejecting.
